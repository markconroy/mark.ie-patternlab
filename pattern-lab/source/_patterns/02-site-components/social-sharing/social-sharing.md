title: social-sharing
---
This is our default social sharing widget. The variables set in it come from the Drupal 'More Global Variables'. This means, you must have this module installed to use this feature.

You must also ensure you have corresponding icons in the /basic-elements/icons/svg directory.

To use this widget, just include it in your pattern;
`{% include '@site-components/social-sharing/social-sharing.twig' %}`
