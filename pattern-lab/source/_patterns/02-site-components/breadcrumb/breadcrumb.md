Title: Breadcrumbs
---

This is the breadcrumbs block. The block is placed in the 'Breadcrumbs' region. The file for that region is in the 'Page Sections' directory, along with the other regions.

After the breadcrumb shows the trail, it then prints the {{ current_page_title }}. In Drupal, this is created using the MGV - More Global Variables - module.
