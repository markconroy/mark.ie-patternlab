Title: Field Labels
---

There are four states to field labels:
1) Above - the label is above the field.
2) Inline - the label is inline with the field.
3) Hidden - the label is only used by the CMS and not presented to the user.
4) Visually Hidden - the label is not visible to users, but can be read by screenreaders.
