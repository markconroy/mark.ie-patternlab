title: Header
---

This is our default header. It comes in 2 parts:
- The main header area that you can see initially, and
- The "off canvas" header area that you can see when you click on the menu button

The "Off Canvas" is like a "poor man's Drupal region". We use that to load a mobile menu and the search block (and we can put other things in there as well if we wish later).
